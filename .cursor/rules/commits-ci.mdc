# Commits, PRs, and CI

- Use Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, ci)
- Open PRs to `main`; ensure description references relevant milestones
- Required green checks before merge:
  - Backend: ruff/black, mypy, pytest
  - Frontend: eslint, tsc --noEmit, unit tests
- Update docs when behavior or interfaces change:
  - [MVP_imp_plan.md](mdc:MVP_imp_plan.md) for milestones/status
  - [M1.1_spec.md](mdc:M1.1_spec.md) for scaffolding specifics
- No secrets in repo; use GitHub Secrets for CI
