# Formatting and Indentation

- Preserve each fileâ€™s existing indentation characters (tabs vs spaces) and width
- Do not reformat unrelated code when making focused edits
- Match the surrounding code style and naming conventions
- Prefer multi-line clarity over dense one-liners; wrap long lines thoughtfully
- Avoid adding commentary-only lines inside code; keep comments concise and meaningful
