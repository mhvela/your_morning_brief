# Project Structure and Key Documents

Use these documents to understand goals and implementation:
- Product Requirements: [your_morning_brief_PRD.md](mdc:your_morning_brief_PRD.md)
- MVP Implementation Plan: [MVP_imp_plan.md](mdc:MVP_imp_plan.md)
- Milestone 1.1 Detailed Spec: [M1.1_spec.md](mdc:M1.1_spec.md)

High-level layout (planned):
- `backend/`: FastAPI service; health endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/version`), RSS ingestion, ranking, summarization APIs
- `frontend/`: Next.js app with Tailwind; topic management and Daily Brief UI
- `infra/` (optional): Dockerfiles, compose, environment samples
- `.github/workflows/`: CI pipeline for lint, type-check, and tests

When adding or modifying features:
- Keep milestones small and demoable per [MVP_imp_plan.md](mdc:MVP_imp_plan.md)
- For Milestone 1.1 scaffolding specifics, see [M1.1_spec.md](mdc:M1.1_spec.md)
